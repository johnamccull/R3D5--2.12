# 2024-Spring-2.12
2024 Spring 2.12 Final Project Team


# TODO
Electromagnet + test on roof- Amir 
IR integration + testing - Amy
Singularity - Avani + Baran
Test with additional webcam - 
Command to specific z height + print out z height - Kemi (Display TIM height)
Other drivers: Avani, Baran, Kemi


2. Keep robot hand parallel with ground (this should be easy - just start it parallel to the ground!)
3. Have button that goes down to particular height to pick tim up, then up to a particular height to allow movement -> Can move down, but not up yet


# Done
1. prevent going into singularity, OR: if robot is in singularity, get out!!!!!
4. Integrate with IR sensor



# Extra
5. Define some autonomous behaviors/trajectories for scanning for TIM, picking up and dropping off rubble and picking up and dropping off TIM 
(this includes actuating/deactuating gripper and electromagnet and mapping these to controller/keyboard inputs too)


# Setup Procedure 
Procedure for setting up before starting the competition.

1. Move the robot to home position
2. Mount the gripper
3.
